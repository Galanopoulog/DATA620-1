    "For this project, we use the Reuters Corpus ([Reuters 21578](http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/corpora.htm)) data set that comes packaged with [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html). It contains 10,788 business and financial news stories totaling 1.3 million words. The documents have been classified using 90 business topics. For instance, earning reports are flagged 'earn'; commodity price reports are flagged by commodity label ('crude' or 'palm-oil'); economic indicators are labeled by type ('cpi', 'gnp'), etc. (For definitions, see Appendix A.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Categories in the Reuters Corpus overlap each other, because a news story often covers multiple topics. Our goal was to build a model with the training dataset to predict the class of new documents in the test dataset. For news articles with multiple labels, we used label listed first to train and test. To experiment, we employed both Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers to train the data. Results showed that SVM had a higher overall classification accuracy (appox. 90 percent) compared to Naive Bayes (84 percent).\n"

    "In this section we elected to try a number of different techniques for training our Reuter’s Classifier from the SVM to bigrams and other classifiers. We have published the two methods that we found that improve the performance of the classifier. The Support Vector Machine uses stochastic gradient descent to find the weights of the various words for predicting each of the categories. This method outperforms the Naive Bayes method with the SVM giving an accuracy of 90.4%. We also see that many of our misclassified documents fall into the trap of being able to be logically classified into many different categories. Our other attempts at modifying the model ultimately led to worse results than our basic word frequency classifier and we find it interesting how good a job of classification a model can achieve with such a basic measure."
