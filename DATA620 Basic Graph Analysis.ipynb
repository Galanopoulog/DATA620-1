    "For this weeks assignment we have selected some data from the Stanford Netwok Aanalysis Project on the scientific collaborations between authors whose papers were submitted to Astro Physics category of Arxiv. Each node on the graph is an author and each edge of the graph indicates that the authors collaborated on a given paper. We have downloaded and extracted the file into a text file. Working with the data we realized that there were issues with the connectedness of the graph when looking at the full set  of nodes adn edges. There were also 198,110 edges which we felt might be a little large to work with for this frist project. We have elected to look at the first 501 eleents of that data set. \n",
